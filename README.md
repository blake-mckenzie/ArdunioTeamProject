Bylaws:
If a group member is absent for more than a week straight, they have to leave the group
Driver has to actually develop when driving
Navigator has to actually help the Driver and not just sit and twirl in their chair without touching the keyboard
If you are slacking off you have to be a Driver for an extra day
No saying bad words towards each other
Being positive
